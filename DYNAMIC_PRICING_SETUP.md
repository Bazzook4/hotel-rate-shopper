## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Airtable Tables

1. Log in to your Airtable account
2. Open your existing base (the one used for your Rate Shopper app)
3. Create the 5 tables listed above with the exact field names and types

**Important Notes:**
- Field names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use the correct field types (Single line text, Number, Date, etc.)
- The `id` field is auto-generated by Airtable, don't create it manually

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file (optional, as defaults are provided):

```bash
AIRTABLE_DYNAMIC_PRICING_HOTELS_TABLE=DynamicPricingHotels
AIRTABLE_ROOM_TYPES_TABLE=RoomTypes
AIRTABLE_RATE_PLANS_TABLE=RatePlans
AIRTABLE_PRICING_FACTORS_TABLE=PricingFactors
AIRTABLE_PRICING_SNAPSHOTS_TABLE=PricingSnapshots
```

If you don't add these, the default table names above will be used.

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Access Dynamic Pricing

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Click on the "Dynamic Pricing ðŸ’°" tab in the sidebar

### Configuring Pricing Factors

The configuration page has several sections:

#### Pricing Parameters
- **Check-in/Check-out Dates**: The dates for which you want pricing recommendations
- **Current Occupancy**: Your current occupancy percentage
- **Include Competitor Pricing**: Toggle to use competitor data from other properties

#### Occupancy Multipliers
- **Low (0-30%)**: Typically 0.9 (10% discount to attract bookings)
- **Medium (31-70%)**: Typically 1.0 (no change)
- **High (71-100%)**: Typically 1.2 (20% premium due to high demand)

#### Seasonality
- **Peak Season Start/End**: Define your peak season dates
- **Peak Season Multiplier**: Typically 1.3 (30% premium)
- **Off-Peak Multiplier**: Typically 0.95 (5% discount)

#### Day of Week Multipliers
Configure each day individually:
- **Monday/Tuesday**: Typically 0.85 (weekday discount)
- **Friday/Saturday**: Typically 1.1-1.15 (weekend premium)
- **Sunday**: Typically 1.0 (neutral)

#### Lead Time Multipliers
- **0-3 Days**: 1.2 (last-minute premium)
- **4-7 Days**: 1.1
- **8-14 Days**: 1.0 (baseline)
- **15-30 Days**: 0.95
- **31+ Days**: 0.9 (early bird discount)

#### Length of Stay Multipliers
- **1 Night**: 1.0 (no discount)
- **2-3 Nights**: 0.98 (2% discount)
- **4-6 Nights**: 0.95 (5% discount)
- **7+ Nights**: 0.9 (10% discount)

#### Competitor Pricing
- **Weight (0-1)**: How much influence competitor prices have
  - 0 = Ignore competitors completely
  - 0.3 = Moderate influence (recommended)
  - 1 = Maximum influence

### Generating Recommendations

1. After configuring factors, click "Save Configuration"
2. Click "Calculate Pricing"
3. View your recommendations with:
   - Summary cards showing total rooms, occupancy, avg prices, and revenue change
   - AI-powered recommendations based on market conditions
   - Competitor analysis (if enabled)
   - Detailed room-by-room pricing with factor breakdowns

### Copying Results

Click the "Copy Results" button to copy a formatted text version of all recommendations to your clipboard. The format includes:
- Hotel and booking details
- Summary metrics
- Room pricing breakdown with all factor impacts
- AI recommendations

You can paste this directly into emails, spreadsheets, or your PMS.

## Understanding the Pricing Algorithm

The recommended price is calculated as:

```
Recommended Price = Base Price Ã—
  Occupancy Multiplier Ã—
  Seasonality Multiplier Ã—
  Day of Week Multiplier Ã—
  Lead Time Multiplier Ã—
  Length of Stay Multiplier Ã—
  Competitor Pricing Multiplier
```

### Example Calculation

**Base Price**: $100
**Occupancy**: 75% â†’ High (1.2x)
**Season**: Peak (1.3x)
**Day**: Friday (1.1x)
**Lead Time**: 10 days â†’ 8-14 range (1.0x)
**Length**: 2 nights â†’ 2-3 range (0.98x)
**Competitor**: Avg competitor $120, weight 0.3 â†’ 1.06x

**Calculation**:
$100 Ã— 1.2 Ã— 1.3 Ã— 1.1 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 0.98 Ã— 1.06 = **$163.34**

This represents a 63.34% increase from the base price due to favorable market conditions.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with multipliers close to 1.0 and adjust based on actual booking patterns
2. **Review Regularly**: Update pricing factors monthly or seasonally
3. **Monitor Competitors**: Enable competitor pricing to stay market-competitive
4. **Test and Iterate**: Run different scenarios before implementing prices
5. **Save Snapshots**: The system automatically saves pricing snapshots for historical analysis
6. **Use AI Recommendations**: Pay attention to the AI-generated suggestions for occupancy optimization

## Troubleshooting

### "No room types configured for this hotel"
- Make sure you've added at least one room type before calculating pricing

### "Pricing factors not configured for this hotel"
- Complete the pricing configuration step before calculating

### Competitor pricing not working
- Ensure you have multiple hotels configured in the system
- Check that "Include Competitor Pricing" is enabled
- Set the competitor pricing weight > 0

### Can't see Dynamic Pricing tab
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check that your session is active
